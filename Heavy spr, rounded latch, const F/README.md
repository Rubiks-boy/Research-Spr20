Accepts parameters for a spring-latch system with a heavy spring & rounded latch with some unlatching time t_l.
Week following 30 Jan:
- Derived equations to describe prior to unlatching, between unlatching and taking off, and after takeoff.
- Made a first attempt at coding it up in Matlab. This became a nightmare to debug; there appears to be a lot wrong with it, and a function-driven approach made debugging difficult. 
- Plan for next week: code one small part at a time, and debug as I go.
