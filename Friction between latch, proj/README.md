Accepts parameters for a spring-latch system with friction between the projectile and the latch.

Week following 2 Apr:
- Began working on derivations for when there's friction between the latch & projectile (not in this repo)

Week following 9 Apr:
- Added preliminary derivations wrt theta
- Compared this to Prof. Ilton's derivations, which were based on y position
